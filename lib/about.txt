I've always been driven by the idea of producing technology for future generations. I like to imagine what my kids or grandkids may need in 40-50 years, and what I can do in my life to help them.<br><br>

This desire has led me to experiment in different fields ranging from farming, hospital services, security, and tech support, all the way to missions work in Mexico and Cambodia. These experiences taught me how to spot certain needs of different people around the globe and have invoked thoughts of what I can do to help them. Which led me to the DaVinci Institute in 2016 for a Python Web development boot camp, and I found that software development is what I wanted to do with my life. I continued to work with Python on and off for a couple of years, until September of 2019 when I was able to attend Turing School of Software & Design.<br><br>

Through Turing's Back-End Engineering program, I learned a wide array of skills ranging from writing Ruby and how the Agile development process works to deploying full Sinatra, Rails, and Flask apps on Heroku. I worked on an array of projects in over 1000 hours between solo, paired, and group projects. These projects grew my knowledge and enhanced my 'software developer tool belt' - the most important skill I picked up is HOW to learn, which encouraged me as a life-long learner to always pursue new skills.
